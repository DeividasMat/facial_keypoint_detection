# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Overview
This project are part of Computer vision Nanodergee via Udacity. Facial keypoints  specify the areas of the nose, eyes, mouth, etc on the face, classified by 68 key points. Using CNN, pytorch and opencv build a facial keypoint detection system that takes any images with human faces and detect main 68 keypoints.

## Structure

Project split in 3 main notebooks and models.py file.

1) models.py -- Model architecture.
2) Load and Visualize Data.ipynb -- Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data
3) Define the Network Architecture.ipynb -- Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints.
4) Facial Keypoint Detection, Complete Pipeline.ipynb --Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN.
5) Fun with Keypoints.ipynb -- Fun expiriements with keypoints.
